TODO
----

General
-------
[ ] Design: Should controller modify text directly and let view know?
[ ] Optimization: Memory Profiling
[ ] Issue: Figure out Kiwi integration

Controller
----------
[ ] Null style should not cause crazy behavior
[ ] Feature: Store a single page and persist
[ ] Issue: Popover + scroll view weirdness if rotated when visible

Text View
---------
[ ] Feature: Tokenization and movement - e.g. make sure selection isn't allowed to be empty
[ ] Feature: Selection handles
[ ] Feature: Scrolling behavior while editing
[ ] Feature: Cut copy paste
[ ] Feature: Context menus w/ selection
[ ] Issue: An issue with weird hardware keyboard movement during text input? Beat on test cases more
[ ] Feature: Undo/Redo support
[ ] Design: Cancel double tap and press if duration too long or distance too short?
[ ] Design: follow UITextView conventions on ownership and follow conventions more closely
[ ] Optimization: Use a dirty marker for typesetting e.g.: [self setLineWidthDirty];
[ ] Optimization: Typeset at line granularity lazily
[ ] Optimization: Don't need skirt lines - can use typographic bounds
[ ] Optimization: Low memory - purge recycled sections
[ ] Issue: Drawing underlines - not pixel perfect :(

Deferred
--------
[ ] Issue: When end of text is newline, keyboard up movement granularity has minor issue when caret is on the last line
[ ] Design: Better icons for B/I/U
[ ] Issue: Bradley hand - no regular variant, only bold variant
[ ] Issue: Copperplate italic?
[ ] Issue: autocorrection and changing styles concurrently ... Tough to infer what intention is when a mixed styled word is replaced with what could be totally different word
[ ] Issue: Weird underline drawing behavior with and without line break / descender glyphs (g, p, etc)
[ ] Issue: Insertion when position within marked text modified - UITextInput bug?
[ ] Issue: Whitespace at end of line not being handled properly
[ ] Issue: Selection color off
[ ] Issue: Typesetting lines with trailing white space causes some weird issues

Done
----
[x] Issue: Tap out of bounds latches to x coordinate
[x] Issue: Keyboard input mostly works
[x] Issue: Select all when text doesn't end with newline
[x] Issue: Refactor tokenizer
[x] Issue: Use newline char set instead of \n
