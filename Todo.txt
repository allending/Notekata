Controller
----------
[ ] Issue: Typewriter font synching broken - AmericanTypewriter / AmericanTypewriter-Bold
[ ] Issue: Marker felt
[ ] Issue: Toggling traits should add/remove, not reset every trait and font
[ ] Design: Better icons for B/I/U
[ ] Feature: Store a single page and persist
[ ] Design: Controller responsible for setting up styles of text view
[ ] Issue: Popover + scroll view weirdness if rotated when visible

Text View
---------
[ ] Issue: Not convinced typing attributes 100% correct yet...
[ ] Issue: Copperplate italic?
[ ] Issue: Keyboard input
[ ] Design: Cancel double tap and press if duration too long or distance too short?
[ ] Feature: Tokenization and movement - e.g. make sure selection isn't allowed to be empty
[ ] Feature: Selection handles
[ ] Feature: Scrolling behavior while editing
[ ] Feature: Cut copy paste
[ ] Feature: Context menus w/ selection
[ ] Design: follow UITextView conventions on ownership and follow conventions more closely
[ ] Optimization: Use a dirty marker for typesetting e.g.: [self setLineWidthDirty];
[ ] Optimization: Typeset at line granularity lazily
[ ] Optimization: Don't need skirt lines - can use typographic bounds
[ ] Optimization: Low memory - purge recycled sections

Deferred
--------
[ ] Issue: autocorrection and changing styles concurrently ... Tough to infer what intention is when a mixed styled word is replaced with what could be totally different word
[ ] Issue: Weird underline drawing behavior with and without line break / descender glyphs (g, p, etc)
[ ] Issue: Insertion when position within marked text modified - UITextInput bug?
[ ] Issue: Whitespace at end of line not being handled properly
[ ] Issue: Selection color off
[ ] Issue: Typesetting lines with trailing white space causes some weird issues
