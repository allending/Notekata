Make property access consistent

Controller

Design: Controller responsible for setting up styles of text view

Text View
---------
Issue: UITextInput autocorrection dying, workaround -> provide a fake view?
Issue: blank -> (zh)ni (db) (db) (english) you
Issue: blank -> (zh)na (db) (db) (english) abcd
Issue: unmarkText not being called correctly?
Issue: ni hao ma (space) n (delete backwards) -> crash
Issue: n (db) (db) (db) crash on empty page
Issue: Select all text and delete

Issue: Emulate api of UITextView more
Feature: Scrolling behavior while editing
Optimization: Typeset at line granularity lazily
Optimization: Don't need skirt lines - can use typographic bounds
Optimization: Low memory - purge recycled sections

Deferred
--------
Issue: Whitespace at end of line not being handled properly
Issue: Selection color off
