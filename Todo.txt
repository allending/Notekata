Design: Controller responsible for setting up styles of text view

Text View
---------
Feature: Marked text visuals...
Issue: Make meaning of text position styling / fonts consistent (autocorrect, insertion text, etc)
Issue: Empty doc, double tap select, long press select, visual behavior
Issue: Emulate api of UITextView more
Feature: Scrolling behavior while editing
Optimization: Typeset at line granularity lazily
Optimization: Don't need skirt lines - can use typographic bounds
Optimization: Low memory - purge recycled sections
Design: Change default font

Deferred
--------
Issue: Whitespace at end of line not being handled properly
Issue: Selection color off
