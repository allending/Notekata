TODO
----

General
-------
[ ] Optimization: Memory Profiling
[ ] Issue: Figure out Kiwi integration

Model
-----
[ ] BIG Issue: Persistance problem still present, full diagnostic sweep required

Controller
----------
[ ] Issue: Null style should not cause crazy behavior
[ ] Issue: Popover + scroll view weirdness if rotated when visible

Text View
---------
[ ] Issue: Typesetting - line with spaces prefix, not all the way to end "    Yeah, so this is starting to be pretty freaking cool!" and enter newline issue.
[ ] Issue: Correction prompt not getting right rects (untransformed)? - Can't reproduce
[ ] Issue: keyboard movement wonky with new changes (see screenshot)
[ ] Optimization: Shit load of tiling/untiling during startup?
[ ] Design: Adjust drag handle gesture to use point just above or below actual gesture location
[ ] Issue: Clamping loupes does not actually work correctly with multipage bounds
[ ] Issue: Dragging the handle slightly should not change line immediately
[ ] Feature: Context menus w/ selection
[ ] Feature: Cut copy paste
[ ] Feature: Scrolling behavior while editing
[ ] Feature: Undo/Redo support
[ ] Issue: Test keyboard movement on actual hardware
[ ] Issue: An issue with weird hardware keyboard movement during text input? Beat on test cases more
[ ] Design: Cancel double tap and press if duration too long or distance too short?
[ ] Optimization: Don't need skirt lines - can use typographic bounds
[ ] Optimization: Low memory - purge recycled sections
[ ] Issue: Drawing underlines - not pixel perfect :(
[ ] Issue: Test Chinese handwriting

Done
----

Deferred
--------
[ ] Issue: Loupe drawing needs to lag by 1 frame ... - HACKED for now
[ ] Issue: When end of text is newline, keyboard up movement has minor issue when caret is on the last line - small enough to ignore for now
[ ] Design: Better icons for B/I/U
[ ] Issue: Bradley hand - no regular variant, only bold variant
[ ] Issue: Copperplate italic?
[ ] Issue: autocorrection and changing styles concurrently ... Tough to infer what intention is when a mixed styled word is replaced with what could be totally different word
[ ] Issue: Weird underline drawing behavior with and without line break / descender glyphs (g, p, etc)
[ ] Issue: Insertion when position within marked text modified - UITextInput bug?
[ ] Issue: Whitespace at end of line not being handled properly
[ ] Issue: Selection color off
[ ] Issue: Typesetting lines with trailing white space causes some weird issues
