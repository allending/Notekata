Text View
---------
Optimization: Typeset at line granularity lazily
x Crash: Creating text sections that won't display any lines..
x Issue: first line clipping glyphs?
Issue: Text view doesn't rotate properly
Issue: what if glyphs from non visible line enter visible line? solve by design? buffer 1 on top and bottom and limit point size
Issue: text clips if section frames are just right. can solve by adding some padding to frame?
