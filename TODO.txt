Controller

Design: Controller responsible for setting up styles of text view

Text View
---------
Issue: Default Line Height + Large Margins -> last horizontal rule missing
Issue: Text view doesn't rotate properly
Optimization: Typeset at line granularity lazily

x Feature: Lines/Styles
x Issue: Unlimited line drawing fails when using large margins
x Issue: what if glyphs from non visible line enter visible line? solve by design? buffer 1 on top and bottom and limit point size
x Issue: text clips if section frames are just right. can solve by adding some padding to frame?
x Crash: Creating text sections that won't display any lines..
x Issue: first line clipping glyphs?
