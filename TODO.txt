Iteration goals
Issue: Tap beyong line should place caret at end of line.
Issue: Caret should be sized with ascent + descent
Start on input - implement UIKeyInput protocol
Optimization: Typeset at line granularity lazily
Optimization: Low memory - purge recycled sections

x Issue: Make position computations clearer in text section
x Issue: Default Line Height + Large Margins -> last horizontal rule missing
x Issue: Text view doesn't rotate properly
x Feature: Lines/Styles
x Issue: Unlimited line drawing fails when using large margins
x Issue: what if glyphs from non visible line enter visible line? solve by design? buffer 1 on top and bottom and limit point size
x Issue: text clips if section frames are just right. can solve by adding some padding to frame?
x Crash: Creating text sections that won't display any lines..
x Issue: first line clipping glyphs?
